<p>For the unicode to ascii convertion I used <a href="http://rishida.net/tools/conversion/">http://rishida.net/tools/conversion/</a>.</p>
<p>Also, <b>HAVE IN MIND</b> that you may find guitar pro tabs of Greek rock music at <a href="http://www.greekrocktabs.gr">http://www.greekrocktabs.gr</a>.</p>

How To Install the Language
---------------------------

<p>In order to install a new language the only thing you have to do is to place the language file (in our case the mesages_el.properties) into the lang folder, specifically into <i>$TUXGUITAR_DIR\share\lang</i> and it will appear in languages next time you run the application. If you can't locate the file you can use <i>locate tuxguitar</i> in Linux or <i>right click on shortcut --> properties --> find target...</i> in Windows.</p>
